# Final Project â€“ Arcade Game Cabinet 
## Ainsley _, Brynlee _, Kalei Foley-Rutherfurd

For our final project, we created a game cabinet with some basic games. There are 4 games:
- Whack-a-Mole
- Hang man
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Lights out

Each have their own page and functions. All style and java are done within each file (Game1.html-Game4.html respectively).

### Future work
To make this better, the games could be overall more advanced or have a cleaner overall look. But they all do what they are supposed to do.
