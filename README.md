# Final Project â€“ Arcade Game Cabinet 
## Ainsley Balda, Brynlee Maya Crispin, Kalei Foley-Rutherfurd

For our final project, we created a game cabinet with some basic games. There are 4 games:
- Whack-a-Mole
- Hang man
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Lights out

Each have their own page and functions. All style and java are done within each file (Game1.html-Game4.html respectively). Each game has their own style because they were made by different people in the group.

### Future work
To make this better, the games could be overall more advanced or have a cleaner overall look. But each game functions as, there's just some overall aesthetic things that could be worked out.
